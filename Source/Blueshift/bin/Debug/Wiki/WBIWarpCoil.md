            
Warp coils produce the warp capacity needed for vessels to go faster than light. Warp capacity is a fixed resource, but the resources needed to produce it are entirely optional. ` MODULE { name = WBIWarpCoil textureModuleID = WarpCoil warpCapacity = 10 RESOURCE { name = GravityWaves rate = 200 FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW } } `
        
## Fields

### debugMode
A flag to enable/disable debug mode.
### textureModuleID
Warp coils can control WBIAnimatedTexture modules. This field tells the generator which WBIAnimatedTexture to control.
### runningEffect
Warp coils can play a running effect while the generator is running.
### waterfallEffectController
Name of the Waterfall effects controller that controls the warp effects (if any).
### warpCapacity
The amount of warp capacity that the coil can produce.
### isActivated
The activation switch. When not running, the animations won't be animated.
### animationThrottle
A control to vary the animation speed between minFramesPerSecond and maxFramesPerSecond
### displacementImpulse
Warp coils can efficiently move a certain amount of mass to light speed and beyond without penalties. Going over this limit incurs performance penalties, but staying under this value provides benefits. The displacement value is rated in metric tons.
### waterfallFXModule
Optional (but highly recommended) Waterfall effects module
