Changes

- Added minRendezvousDistancePlanetary and minRendezvousDistanceInterplanetary to Blueshift/settings.cfg. They specify, in meters, the minimum distance required to rendezvous with a vessel via the warp engine's auto-circularization feature. They apply to planetary and interplanetart space, respectively.

- Added rendezvousDistance to Blueshift/settings.cfg. It specifies, in meters, how close to the targed vessel should you end up at when you rendezvous with it during auto-circularization or a jump.

- WBIJumpGate's rendezvousDistance will defer to the rendezvousDistance in Blueshift/settings.cfg if set to -1 (it is -1 by default).
