Changes

- Stock ISRU Surface Scanner can now scan for Graviolium.
- Added exospheric resource definitions for Graviolium.
- Comets might contain Graviolium along with asteroids.
- Gravitic generators will now drain their Gravity Waves when shut off. Forgot to add that before...
- You can now enable "Auto-circularize orbit after warp" from the Game Settings -> Custom -> Blueshift menu. If enabled, ships will auto-circularize their orbit around a planet or moon 3 seconds after you cut the throttle and stop warp travel. Going to warp again or shutting down the engine will cancel the timer. You can change the delay by editing the autoCircularizationDelay field in Blueshift's Settings.cfg file.
NOTE: Auto-circularization costs a small amount of Graviolium and is based on vessel mass. See circularizationResource and circularizationCostPerTonne in Settings.cfg.
