Changes

Warp Tech

- Warp engines, gravitic generators, warp coils, resource harvesters, and the Astria Porta Arbitrium can now require maintenance in the form of one or more EVA Repair Kits after operating for long periods of time. This is enabled through the "Parts require maintenance" Game Settings difficulty option, and it is turned off by default.

- Warp engines have a new option to "Supercharge Warp Coils." When enabled (it is enabled by default), the engine will use any excess Gravity Waves- or whatever resources the warp coils consume- to gain as much Warp Capacity as possible from the coils. Now you don't need to spam warp coils and gravitic generators to make heavy haulers; just spam gravitic generators instead.
NOTE: If you have part maintenance turned on, then warp coils will wear out faster when you also have "Supercharge Warp Coils" enabled.

- Highly skilled 5-star kerbals with the Converter Skill (Engineers have this) can coax a bit more power out of the warp engines and enable them to go just a bit faster. Scottish accent is optional. 
NOTE: You can configure the WBIWarpEngine's warpEngineerSkill (defaults to "ConverterSkill"), warpSpeedBoostRank (defaults to 5), and warpSpeedSkillMultiplier (defaults to 0.01) to adjust which skills provide which speed benefits.

Other

- Added additional localization support.

- Added WBIRepairBot part module. This allows a part to be designated as a repair bot that can perform repairs on Blueshift parts that require maintenance.

- Added a new field to SPACE_ANOMALY called vesselName. This field lets you override the anomaly name generated by Blueshift.
NOTE: This will lead to duplicate vessel names when maxInstances > 1.

- If a SPACE_ANOMALY is marked as isKnown, then it will automatically appear in the Tracking Station's list of vessels.

- Fixed an issue where Blueshift could not generate random flyby orbits around the Sun.
