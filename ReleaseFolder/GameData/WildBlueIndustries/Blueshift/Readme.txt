Changes

- Added support for Community Category Kit.
- Refactored the Astria Porta so that it no longer requires players to dock segments to complete the ring. You still need to haul support segments to the construction site, but once there, just press "Install segment" on the control segment and the support segment will vanish from the cargo vessel and be added to the ring. Once all the segments are in place, the ring becomes operational.
- Warp engines now allow you to circularize around stars.
- Fixed fatal error generated by B9 Part Switch when it is installed along with Wild Blue Tools.
- Fixed issue where vessels could circularize their orbit near a target vessel from across the solar system.
- Fixed issue with auto-circularization not respecting the desired orbit inclination.
