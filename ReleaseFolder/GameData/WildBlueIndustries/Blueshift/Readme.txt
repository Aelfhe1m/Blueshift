Changes

- Added Max Warp Speed display field to the warp engine PAW. It is available both in flight and in the editor.
- Added Effective Warp Capacity field to the warp engine PAW. It is available in the editor.
- Added new FTL Check field to the warp engine PAW. It is available both in flight and in the editor. It will let you know if the warp engine lacks sufficient effective warp capacity to achieve FTL.
- Removed vessel size restriction on jumpgates; the stock vessel size calculations are too inaccurate.
