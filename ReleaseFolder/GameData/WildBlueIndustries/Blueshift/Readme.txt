Changes

- Adjusted costs on the parts.
- Most of the parts can now be surface attached.
- Due to their versatility, warp coils now cost more to obtain the same performance as an equivalent Warp Ring.
- When in interstellar space, vessels can go much faster. You can change how much of a speed boost ships get by setting the interstellarWarpSpeedMultiplier in the settings.cfg file. The default is 1000, which is about 2.74 light-years per day.
- Warp engines now require a minimum planetary radius of 1 (down from 3) in order to go to warp.
- You can now combine warp engines to increase the displacement impulse (lets you move more massive ships).
- WBIWarpCoil and WBIModuleGeneratorFX can now support Waterfall along with animated textures and more traditional EFFECTS nodes.
- Added new WBIModuleHarvesterFX. In addition to resource harvesting, it can drive WBIAnimatedTexture modules, a Waterfall effects module, and EFFECT nodes.
