	description = Using a cyclotron instead of a particle accelerator ring gives the gravitic displacement generator a much more compact form than the S-3 Warp Engine's generator, but it comes at the expense of reduced gravity wave output. Instead of relying on parts salvaged from [REDACTED], it uses kerbal-tech to achieve its capabilities.
